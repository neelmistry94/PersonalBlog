~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Set up and push/pull instructions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

git init
	- Do this in the directory you will be holding project files
git remote add origin https://github.com/neelmistry94/PersonalBlog.git
	- This sets origin as Neel's repo


Pull
git pull origin master
	- Do this before you start changing files so you can see what updates other group members have made! 

Push
git add [list of files you have modified] / git add * 
	- Star will add all files in directory
git commit -m "Note about modifed files"
git push origin master

Lets all do work on our own branches....

git checkout -b Bens_Branch
	- Name it your name and branch, not Bens_Branch....That is me
git status
	- Should show that you are on your branch, not the master branch
git add
	- Same as above
git commit -m "Message to coders"
git push --set-upstream origin Bens_Branch
	 - Instructions to set origin should be set at the top of this page
	 - Now whenever you are on your own branch, git push after adding and commiting should suffice
